                    Healthy food is important both for our body and mind. We must eat vegetables 
                    and fruits in a large amount because they provide all the nutrients to us. 
                    Green vegetables have iron and fruits like peaches, banana has potassium and 
                    strawberries.  Oranges keep our teeth healthy. We must also drink milk daily 
                    because it has calcium which makes our bones strong.
